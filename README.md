[![Tests](https://github.com/lazyants/lexware-mcp-server/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lazyants/lexware-mcp-server/actions/workflows/test.yml)

MCP server for the [Lexware Office API](https://developers.lexware.io/docs/). Manage invoices, contacts, articles, vouchers, and more through the Model Context Protocol.

> **Unofficial — community project.** Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Lexware GmbH or Haufe Group. "Lexware" and "Lexware Office" are trademarks of their respective owners; used here only to identify the API this client targets (nominative fair use).

**66 tools** across 20 resource domains, with 6 entry points so you can pick the right server for your MCP client's tool limit.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @lazyants/lexware-mcp-server
```

Or run directly:

```bash
npx @lazyants/lexware-mcp-server
```

## Configuration

The API token is resolved in this order:

1. **OS keyring** (recommended — token never written to disk in plain text)
2. **Environment variable** `LEXWARE_API_TOKEN`

### Store the token in the OS keyring

Get your token from the [Lexware Office API settings](https://app.lexware.de/addons/public-api), then store it with the native credential manager for your OS.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The commands below read the token from an interactive prompt rather than
> taking it as an argument, so it never lands in your shell history or the
> process list. Avoid pasting the token directly onto the command line.

#### macOS

Omitting the value after `-w` makes `security` prompt for the token (with confirmation):

```bash
security add-generic-password -s "lexware-mcp" -a "api-token" -w
```

#### Windows (PowerShell)

`cmdkey` can only take the token as a command-line argument, which exposes it in
the process list. Instead, read it from a hidden prompt and write it straight
into Windows Credential Manager via `CredWrite`, so the token never reaches argv.
The credential's target name is `<account>.<service>` — `api-token.lexware-mcp`
for the default service — which is exactly what the server reads back:

```powershell
$secure = Read-Host -AsSecureString "Lexware API token"
Add-Type -Namespace LexwareKeyring -Name Native -MemberDefinition @'
[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential, CharSet = CharSet.Unicode)]
public struct CREDENTIAL {
    public uint Flags;
    public uint Type;
    [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPWStr)] public string TargetName;
    [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPWStr)] public string Comment;
    public System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComTypes.FILETIME LastWritten;
    public uint CredentialBlobSize;
    public IntPtr CredentialBlob;
    public uint Persist;
    public uint AttributeCount;
    public IntPtr Attributes;
    [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPWStr)] public string TargetAlias;
    [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPWStr)] public string UserName;
}
[DllImport("advapi32.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Unicode, SetLastError = true)]
public static extern bool CredWriteW(ref CREDENTIAL credential, uint flags);
'@
$blob = [Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToCoTaskMemUnicode($secure)
try {
    $cred = New-Object LexwareKeyring.Native+CREDENTIAL
    $cred.Type = 1                              # CRED_TYPE_GENERIC
    $cred.Persist = 2                           # CRED_PERSIST_LOCAL_MACHINE
    $cred.TargetName = 'api-token.lexware-mcp'  # "<account>.<service>"
    $cred.UserName = 'api-token'
    $cred.CredentialBlob = $blob
    $cred.CredentialBlobSize = $secure.Length * 2   # UTF-16 bytes, no terminator
    if (-not [LexwareKeyring.Native]::CredWriteW([ref]$cred, 0)) {
        throw "CredWrite failed (Win32 error $([Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::GetLastWin32Error()))"
    }
    Write-Host 'Stored Lexware API token in Windows Credential Manager.'
} finally {
    [Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::ZeroFreeCoTaskMemUnicode($blob)
    $secure.Dispose()
    Remove-Variable secure, blob
}
```

> Using a custom `LEXWARE_KEYRING_SERVICE` (e.g. `acme`)? Set `TargetName` to
> `api-token.acme` to match — the server looks the token up under
> `<account>.<service>`.

#### Linux

```bash
secret-tool store --label="Lexware Office API" service lexware-mcp username api-token
# (prompts for the token value)
```

Once stored, MCP config files need no credentials at all — the server reads the token from the keyring at startup.

### Use an environment variable instead

If you prefer not to use the keyring, set `LEXWARE_API_TOKEN` in your shell or MCP client config:

```bash
export LEXWARE_API_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LEXWARE_API_TOKEN` | — | API token; used when the keyring has no entry for the configured service |
| `LEXWARE_KEYRING_SERVICE` | `lexware-mcp` | Keyring service name. Override when connecting to multiple Lexware accounts simultaneously — run one server instance per account, each with its own service name |

Optionally override the webhook-signature public key used by `lexware_verify_webhook_signature`
(by default fetched from Lexware and cached):

```bash
export LEXWARE_WEBHOOK_PUBLIC_KEY="$(cat lexware-webhook-public.pem)"
```

## Entry Points

Use split servers to reduce context size — pick only the splits you need.

## Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`. If you stored the token in the OS keyring under the default service name `lexware-mcp` (recommended), no `env` key is needed:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lexware": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@lazyants/lexware-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you prefer the environment variable approach:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lexware": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@lazyants/lexware-mcp-server"],
      "env": { "LEXWARE_API_TOKEN": "your-token-here" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Split servers

Use split servers to reduce context size — pick only the entry points you need. The `-p @lazyants/lexware-mcp-server` flag tells `npx` which package to source the command from; the final argument (e.g. `lexware-mcp-sales`) is the specific entry-point binary defined in that package (see [Entry Points](#entry-points)):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lexware-sales": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "-p", "@lazyants/lexware-mcp-server", "lexware-mcp-sales"]
    },
    "lexware-contacts": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "-p", "@lazyants/lexware-mcp-server", "lexware-mcp-contacts"]
    }
  }
}
```

Multi-account example (two Lexware companies, tokens stored under separate keyring service names):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lexware-company-a": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@lazyants/lexware-mcp-server"],
      "env": { "LEXWARE_KEYRING_SERVICE": "lexware-company-a" }
    },
    "lexware-company-b": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@lazyants/lexware-mcp-server"],
      "env": { "LEXWARE_KEYRING_SERVICE": "lexware-company-b" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`. With the OS keyring (recommended — assumes the token is stored under the default service name `lexware-mcp`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lexware": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@lazyants/lexware-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

With an environment variable instead:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lexware": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@lazyants/lexware-mcp-server"],
      "env": { "LEXWARE_API_TOKEN": "your-token-here" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

### Invoices (5 tools) — sales

`lexware_create_invoice` (supports `finalize=true` at creation), `lexware_get_invoice`, `lexware_download_invoice_file`, `lexware_pursue_invoice`, `lexware_deeplink_invoice`

### Credit Notes (5 tools) — sales

`lexware_create_credit_note`, `lexware_get_credit_note`, `lexware_download_credit_note_file`, `lexware_pursue_credit_note`, `lexware_deeplink_credit_note`

### Quotations (4 tools) — sales

`lexware_create_quotation`, `lexware_get_quotation`, `lexware_download_quotation_file`, `lexware_deeplink_quotation`

### Order Confirmations (5 tools) — sales

`lexware_create_order_confirmation`, `lexware_get_order_confirmation`, `lexware_download_order_confirmation_file`, `lexware_pursue_order_confirmation`, `lexware_deeplink_order_confirmation`

### Delivery Notes (5 tools) — sales

`lexware_create_delivery_note`, `lexware_get_delivery_note`, `lexware_download_delivery_note_file`, `lexware_pursue_delivery_note`, `lexware_deeplink_delivery_note`

### Down Payment Invoices (3 tools) — sales

`lexware_get_down_payment_invoice`, `lexware_download_down_payment_invoice_file`, `lexware_deeplink_down_payment_invoice`

### Dunnings (4 tools) — sales

`lexware_get_dunning`, `lexware_download_dunning_file`, `lexware_pursue_dunning`, `lexware_deeplink_dunning`

### Voucherlist (1 tool) — sales, bookkeeping

`lexware_list_voucherlist`

By default this is a single-page passthrough of the API response. Two additions are opt-in:

- `fetchAllPages: true` follows pagination until every page is retrieved, capped at 100 requests.
  The result adds `fetchedPages` and `truncated`, the latter marking a set cut short by the cap —
  API fields such as `totalElements` are preserved.
- `contactName` (SQL-style `%`/`_` wildcards, case-insensitive) and `hasOpenAmount` filter
  client-side after fetching, and each implies `fetchAllPages`. They are applied here rather than on
  `lexware_list_vouchers` because `/voucherlist` is the response shape that carries `contactName`
  and `openAmount`.

`page` cannot be combined with any of the three — those modes read every page, so a start offset is
meaningless. Use `size` to control the batch size instead. The combination is rejected rather than
silently ignored, so nobody can believe an offset was honored when it was not.

### Contacts (5 tools) — contacts

`lexware_list_contacts`, `lexware_get_contact`, `lexware_create_contact`, `lexware_update_contact`, `lexware_deeplink_contact`

### Articles (5 tools) — contacts

`lexware_list_articles`, `lexware_get_article`, `lexware_create_article`, `lexware_update_article`, `lexware_delete_article`

### Vouchers (6 tools) — bookkeeping

`lexware_list_vouchers`, `lexware_get_voucher`, `lexware_create_voucher`, `lexware_update_voucher`, `lexware_upload_voucher_file`, `lexware_deeplink_voucher`

`lexware_list_vouchers` **requires** `voucherNumber`. `GET /vouchers` is a lookup endpoint, not a
browsable collection — the API answers `400 "voucherNumber parameter is required"` without it. To
browse or filter vouchers, use `lexware_list_voucherlist`, which is the collection endpoint and also
carries the summary fields (`contactName`, `openAmount`) that `/vouchers` does not.

`lexware_get_voucher` normalizes `voucherStatus` to lowercase and retries a 404 three times
(1 s / 2 s / 4 s) to cover the indexing delay after an upload; if the voucher is still missing it
returns `{ voucherId, status: "processing", message }`. Other failures are reported as errors.

### Payments (1 tool) — bookkeeping

`lexware_get_payments`

### Countries (1 tool) — reference

`lexware_list_countries`

### Payment Conditions (1 tool) — reference

`lexware_list_payment_conditions`

### Posting Categories (1 tool) — reference

`lexware_list_posting_categories`

### Profile (1 tool) — reference

`lexware_get_profile`

### Print Layouts (1 tool) — reference

`lexware_list_print_layouts`

### Event Subscriptions (5 tools) — system

`lexware_create_event_subscription`, `lexware_list_event_subscriptions`, `lexware_get_event_subscription`, `lexware_delete_event_subscription`, `lexware_verify_webhook_signature`

### Files (4 tools) — system

`lexware_upload_file`, `lexware_download_file`, `lexware_get_file_status`, `lexware_deeplink_file`

`lexware_get_file_status` calls `GET /files/{id}/status`. The bare `GET /files/{id}` is the binary
download route — with `Accept: application/json` it still answers `200` with the file body
base64-encoded, so it can never yield status metadata. The status route is scope-gated: API keys
without the necessary permission get `access_denied` from Lexware rather than a status.

Both upload tools (`lexware_upload_file` and `lexware_upload_voucher_file`) take the file either as
`contentBase64` or as `filePath` — an absolute path readable by the MCP server process. Prefer
`filePath` for anything sizeable: base64 inflates the payload by about a third and has to travel
through the model's context window. With `filePath`, `fileName` defaults to the file's base name and
`contentType` is auto-detected for `.png`, `.jpg`/`.jpeg`, `.tiff`/`.tif` and `.xml`, falling back
to `application/pdf`. Provide exactly one of the two — supplying both, or neither, is a validation
error.

Uploads are capped at 5 MB. For `filePath` the size is taken from the opened descriptor *before* the
file is read, so an oversized file costs a stat rather than a full load into memory, and anything
that is not a regular file is refused outright (reading `/dev/zero` would otherwise never return).
The decoded byte count is checked again afterwards, which also covers `contentBase64`. Failures
carry a `file_too_large` error with the actual and maximum sizes.

### Recurring Templates (3 tools) — system

`lexware_list_recurring_templates`, `lexware_get_recurring_template`, `lexware_deeplink_recurring_template`

## Security

- **Use the OS keyring** to keep your API token out of config files and shell history entirely (see [Configuration](#configuration))
- **Never commit your API token** to version control
- Use **read-only** access when you only need to list/get resources
- **Create, update, and delete tools modify real business data** — invoices, contacts, and accounting records in your Lexware account
- Rate limiting is handled automatically: requests retry with exponential backoff on 429, including file uploads — the multipart body is rebuilt fresh on every retry attempt, so it can be replayed safely

## Releasing

Releases ship via the GitHub Release event. Maintainer flow:

1. Bump the version in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `server.json` (`npm version <x.y.z> --no-git-tag-version` updates the first two together). `npm run check-versions` hard-fails unless `package.json#/version`, `server.json#/packages[0].version`, and both `package-lock.json` version fields (root and `packages[""]`) all agree. `server.json#/version` is checked more loosely: it must be present, but it is only compared against `packages[0].version` as a regression check — it may legitimately be *ahead* (registry-only republishes bump just that field), so a value left behind at the previous release passes with a `WARN:` line and no failure. For an ordinary release both should move together, so read the script's output rather than trusting its exit code. `CHANGELOG.md` is not checked at all.
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Commit, and **merge the version bump to `main` before creating the release**. Then create the tag yourself, on a SHA you have checked, and only then create the release from it:

   ```bash
   V=X.Y.Z && PR=<release-pr-number> &&
     SHA="$(gh pr view "$PR" --json mergeCommit -q .mergeCommit.oid)" && test -n "$SHA" &&
     git fetch origin main && git merge-base --is-ancestor "$SHA" origin/main &&
     PKG="$(git show "$SHA:package.json")" &&
     test "$(printf '%s' "$PKG" | node -pe 'JSON.parse(require("fs").readFileSync(0,"utf8")).version')" = "$V" &&
     CL="$(git show "$SHA:CHANGELOG.md")" &&
     printf '%s\n' "$CL" | awk -v v="$V" 'index($0,"## ["v"]")==1{f=1;next} /^## \[/{f=0} /^\[[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\]:/{f=0} f' > "/tmp/notes-v$V.md" &&
     grep -q '[^[:space:]]' "/tmp/notes-v$V.md" &&
     git tag -a "v$V" "$SHA" -m "v$V" &&
     git push origin "v$V" &&
     gh release create "v$V" --verify-tag --notes-file "/tmp/notes-v$V.md"
   ```

   The failure this prevents: with no existing tag, `gh release create` places one on the **tip of the default branch**, so running it while the bump is still on a release branch tags the *previous* release's commit. The workflow then publishes whatever version it finds in that commit's `package.json`, and you get a `vX.Y.Z` GitHub Release that silently republishes the old version. Nothing downstream catches it — neither the workflow nor `check-versions` compares the tag against the version files (tracked in #103), which is why the sequence above has to do it.

   Each element is load-bearing:

   - **`gh pr view … .mergeCommit.oid`** names the release PR's own squash commit. Do not substitute `git rev-parse origin/main` — that is merely whatever is on `main` at the moment you look, so an unrelated merge landing in the gap gets tagged and shipped instead. `gh` exits 0 and prints nothing for an unmerged PR, hence the explicit `test -n`.
   - **The `&&` chain** stops on the first failure instead of falling through to the irreversible step. Both `git show` calls are assigned to a variable rather than piped directly, so their exit status is actually checked — a pipeline reports only its *last* command's status unless `pipefail` is set, which is not assumed here.
   - **`git merge-base --is-ancestor`** proves the commit is actually reachable from `main`. Mere existence is not enough — a commit can be present locally because some other branch was fetched, and if its version files happen to match it would otherwise sail through every remaining check.
   - **The version test reads `package.json` out of the target commit**, not the working tree, which would still show the right version while `$SHA` pointed elsewhere.
   - **The `awk`** lifts that version's section out of the commit's `CHANGELOG.md` for `--notes-file`. Without it the release body is whatever `--notes-from-tag` finds in the annotation — for this flow, the literal string `vX.Y.Z`, which is a poor release note for any version and an actively misleading one for a major carrying a breaking change. It stops at the next `## [` heading *or* at the first link-reference definition, because the oldest entry in the file has no heading after it and would otherwise swallow the entire link-reference block. `grep -q` rather than `test -s` guards the result: a section that is empty apart from its blank line still produces a one-byte file, which `test -s` accepts.
   - **`--verify-tag`** makes `gh` abort rather than invent a tag if the push did not land — the guard against `gh` falling back to the tip-of-default-branch behavior described above.

   If `gh release create` fails after the tag is already pushed, do not rerun the whole block — it will stop at `git tag`, which is correct. Rerun only the final command.
4. The `Publish to npm + MCP Registry` workflow runs automatically: it `npm publish`es with provenance, polls the registry until the tarball is available, then pushes the matching `server.json` to the MCP Registry via `mcp-publisher`.

The workflow skips `npm publish` cleanly if the version is already on npm (cutover guard for releases that were partially published manually).

### Publishing auth — npm Trusted Publishing (no token)

Publishing uses **npm Trusted Publishing** via OIDC — there is **no `NPM_TOKEN` secret**. The workflow's `id-token: write` permission is exchanged for a short-lived, one-shot publish token at publish time, using the trusted-publisher binding configured for `@lazyants/lexware-mcp-server` in the npm web UI. The only setup required is that trusted-publisher binding on npm; nothing needs to be stored in repository secrets.
